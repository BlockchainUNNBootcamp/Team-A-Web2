## Challenges Encountered

**Throughout the development process, we encountered several challenges:**

'Inadequate power supply, due to the failure of the local power grid system in my area, I haven't been able to get enough power to charge my devices so to meet deadlines, I would take my PC to places where I can charge. Often discomforting myself to get the job done.

Secondly, another major issue I faced was a design problem. Knowing how to style different elements and where to place them seemed quite difficult at first. I had to watch some videos and view other website pages for inspiration.

Lastly, one of the worst problems I had was debugging, especially in the CSS file. I had different issues coming from the style.css file due to one problem, "Merge Error". I would sit for hours, and jump on meetings with my mentor just to get it fixed. In the end, I resolved it by creating a different CSS file for my styling. Talk about stress.....' **-Ehirim Chukwuebuka David**


'I encountered an "error: failed to push some refs to said Github Https", I solved the problem by pushing to a new branch and then switching the branch back to the main.

I also encountered difficulty in the responsiveness of the site.

I had a poor Internet connection made pulling from the repo a little difficult but I was able to switch to a moderately better network.' **-Richard Divine Chinaeke**

'At first, one major problem I had was fear of facing the Project from the Almighty BlockchainUNN as I didn't believe myself achieving something but then after a second thought, I was driven to give it my best and see how it went. I had to rewatch previous videos over and over again to get started.

The second challenge is debugging errors in my code. It was difficult to figure out why my code wasn't working the way I wanted it to most times. I felt so bad at some point in time that it could take me 2-3 hours just to figure out what was wrongðŸ˜ƒ. That alone can be frustrating. Resources online helped me do better.

Thirdly, pushing the code to Github was the worst of it all. The command seemed like a Chinese language to me at first until the time my tutor **Victoria Ofuasia** came in to have on one-on-one meeting with each one of us. Before the meetings, she had dropped quite some steps for us to follow to get it worked out but all was to no avail that at some point in time she spoke in a raised tone "Git add ." "For God's sake"ðŸ˜‚. That was another problem at its peak.
(But she remains one of the best Tutors I have ever come across so far)' **-Okwor Petermary Oluchukwu**
